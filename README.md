# RAG

### Problem Statement:

Professionals and researchers often need to extract specific insights from large PDF documents like
research papers, manuals, reports, and legal contracts. Manually scanning through these files is time-
consuming and inefficient. Leveraging AI can greatly enhance productivity by enabling natural
language interaction with documents.​

​

Develop an AI-powered application that allows users to upload a PDF document and ask questions
based on its content. The system should intelligently retrieve and generate accurate answers using
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.
